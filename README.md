# fuzzyspark

Apache Spark scalable implementation of various fuzzy algorithms for use in a Big Data environment:

- Fuzzy C-Means.
- Chiu's [subtractive clustering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233932671_Fuzzy_Model_Identification_Based_on_Cluster_Estimation) algorithm.
- Wang and Mendel's rule learning [algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3114131_Generating_Fuzzy_Rules_by_Learning_from_Examples) based on space partition.
